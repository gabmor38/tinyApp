To view newly created or existing Urls select "My urls" in the navigation bar.

### Edit or Delete Urls

- Select "My urls" to edit or delete shorten URLS. 

Select the Edit button to update the link for the shortUrl. It will only modify the long link and not the shortone.

If you want to remove a link completely off the list simply select "Delete".
